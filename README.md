# intro-
hello ,, im viktor, i also go by vince, red, and tord, i am a tord irl and i am mainly in the eddsworld corner. my rentries have more information about me.
 I do want to say that i am diagnosed with bi polar/manic depression so my moods will be unstanble, i am very paranoid and can freak out easily so be gentle 
i tend to not hold back on things i dislike and i can also be very hostile, i am very unstable and i say things out of spite, in which i do not mean any of them unless
i specify, i can be very stubborn and i overall have many unhealthy habits, i may be rude and make cruel jokes but i do prefer to be interacted with
